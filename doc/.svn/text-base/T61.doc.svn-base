* T49 ROOT mini-DST libraries

*******************************************************************************

1) General
----------

The NA49 ROOT mini-DST classes are divided in two libraries. One (T49DST) is 
containing all classes that are used to for storing the DSTs in the mini-DST trees and 
consists basically of the ROOT49-classes with a number of extensions. The ROOT49 class 
collection (mainly developed and maintained by Gunther Roland) has already been extensively
used for data analysis in NA49 and serves now as the foundation of the T49 analysis framework. 
The extensions to ROOT49 include on one side additional data-members for each track 
(see T49ParticleRoot / T40ParticleIdRoot), which now also contain the first and last coordinate 
of a track in each chamber and the PID, and on the other side classes for the storage of secondary 
vertices (T4VertexRoot) and Monte Carlo Information (T49EventMCRoot, T49ParticleMCRoot, 
and T49VertexMCRoot). The usage of version dependend streamer functions ensures the backward 
compability of libT49DST. This means that it should be possible to read old ROOT49 mini-DSTs 
using the T49DST-library. On the other hand it should also work to read new mini-DSTs, created with 
T49DST-classes, with root49, however without access to the additional data members.
  The second library (T49ANA) includes all types of analysis-classes that can be used 
to analyze the root mini-DSTs.
  These two libraries can either be directly loaded via gSystem->Load("libT49DST.so") and
gSystem->Load("libT49ANA.so") into the standard ROOT, or one might also use the root49-executable
that has all these classes already included. The root49 additionally contains the TRootDS-class,
originally written by G. Roland, which allows a direct access to NA49-data in DSPACK format.
This way root49 has the same functionality than the former rootds. 

2) Installation
---------------

The T49DST and T49ANA libraries are part of the local-branch of the NA49 library and can
be used on the NA49-Linux-PCs (na49i01-10). To do so, you should add the following to 
your .rootrc:
       # Path used by dynamic loader to find shared libraries
       *.Root.DynamicPath:    .:$ROOTSYS/lib:$NA49/local/lib
Make sure the that the NA49-environmentals are all set:
       setenv NA49_LEVEL new
       source $NA49/etc/na49_env.csh
In order to use the database of existing root mini-DSTs at CERN define the variable ROOT61 as:
       setenv ROOT61 /shift/na49i02/data1/root49-mdst/DST 

If you want to install the libraries on your own, follow this procedure:
  * Make sure that root is installed properly on your machine.
  * Create a top-directory (e.g. T49) on your machine.
  * Add the following lines to your .(t)cshrc:
       setenv NA49_ARCH       Linux
       setenv T49             <your topdirectory>
       setenv T49DST          "$T49/T49DST"
       setenv T49DST_LIB      "$T49DST/lib"
       setenv T49ANA          "$T49/T49ANA"
       setenv T49ANA_LIB      "$T49ANA/lib"
       setenv NEW_PATH        "$T49DST_LIB":"$T49ANA_LIB"
       setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "$NEW_PATH":"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
       setenv NEW_PATH        "$T49/bin"
       setenv PATH            "$NEW_PATH":"$PATH"
  * In the T49/dist-directory of the NA49-library (local-branch) you can find the the file
    T49.tar.gz. Copy this file to your top-directory and unpack it with the command
       tar -xvzf T49.tar.gz
    This will create the directory tree and write out the source- and header-files.
  * Create the directories bin, T49DST/lib and T49ANA/lib.
  * Create the libraries by executing make nods. If everything went fine, 
    you should find root49 in bin, libT49DST.so in T49DST/lib and libT49ANA.so in T49ANA/lib.
    Note that make nods creates a root49 executable that does not contain the TRootDS classes.
    in case you have installed DSPACK properly on your machine, you could also do a
    simple make, which will then also give you access to DSPACK data.
  * Add the following to your .rootrc:
       # Path used by dynamic loader to find shared libraries
       *.Root.DynamicPath:    .:$ROOTSYS/lib:$T49DST_LIB:$T49ANA_LIB
  * If you are using mini-DST copies somewhere else than at CERN, you have to define ROOT61
    accordingly:
       setenv ROOT61     <your directory containing .root49dsts>
